# VanHack JavaScript Code Verification Challenge

This is a programming assessment. Your score will be a reflection of how many test cases your solution has passed and how performant your code is. We will unfortunately not be able to give feedback due to the amount of candidates and completed challenges.

Once you click on 'Start the Assessment', you will have 24 hours to complete it. Do your best! Your code may be submitted to companies so they can review, and will be available on your profile so all employers and VanHack team can see it.

If you have any questions about how the test is evaluated, here you can see in details - https://docs.qualified.io/for-teams/getting-started/scoring/#autonomous-scoring.
When you start, make sure you have time to complete it.

You will be able to retake this challenge only three months from now.
